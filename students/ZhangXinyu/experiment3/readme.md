## non-deep learning digits recognition

knn is applied to achieve digits recognition without the help of deep learning

Training dataset and testing dataset are MNIST.

data_util.py is to extract data from MNIST.

test.py is to recognize handwriting digits applying knn.

The average accuray of this method is about 96%, not so perfect.
